# Changelog

All notable changes to the TsumBeta script will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

- Auto buy boxes

## [v62] - 2024-01-03

### Added

- "Root Detection" pages to allow full game start.

### Changed

- Tsum levels are auto unlocked only if autoplay is active, and then directly before the game starts.
- Added some more wait times while receiving hearts. These should not be notable, but make the script less aggressive. 

### Fixed

- Script can now start the Int'l version, not just the JP one. 
  Which version is started is based on the setting "Japan version?".
- Game start with Robotmon sometimes made the game stuck (permanent "loading" screen on 
  event notifications), so pauses between taps now take longer on startup to better handle daily event 
  notifications.
- Game was sometimes canceled in the last five seconds due to the "blue'ish" flickering.
- Most event cards now won't block script progress anymore.
