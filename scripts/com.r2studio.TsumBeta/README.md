# TsumTsum script
This is the successor of the script `com.r2studio.Tsum`.  

## Roadmap

### ✅ Finished
- Removal of non-functional option "Slow calculation" which was only part of the old code base
- "New highscore" detection and escape
- Do not reset settings to default values on new script version
- Add missing bonus items "+Score", "+Exp", "+Time" and "+Combo"
- Unlock next Tsum level automatically
- Basic support for Pair Tsum skill activations
- "Bingo detection" and escape
- "New Event" detection and escape

### ⏹️ Planned and rather realistic

### ❓ Probably too sophisticated ideas
- Support for Charm Tsum path finding
- Resume autoplay if script is stopped then started while game play
